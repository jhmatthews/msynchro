msynchro
--------------------------------------

msynchro is a simple python package that allows calculation of optically thin synchrotron emission from arbitrary electron distributions. It also include a tridiagonal matrix algorithm for evolving distributions of particle subject to cooling.  

The code is relatively simple, and the documentation at this stage is quite rudimentary.
